    <h1>How Websites Load in a Browser</h1>

    <p>When you type a website address into your browser's address bar and hit enter, a series of events takes place behind the scenes to bring the website to life on your screen.</p>

    <h2>The Process:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The browser converts the domain name (like google.com) into an IP address, which is a numerical address that identifies a device on the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>The browser establishes a connection with the server hosting the website using the TCP protocol.</li>
        <li><strong>The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the website's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>The server receives the request, processes it, and sends back the requested files.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The browser continues to receive and render files until the entire website is loaded. This process can be optimized through various techniques, such as minification, compression, and caching, to improve website performance.</p>
